[A novel approach to mapping land conversion using Google Earth with an application to East Africa](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215001747)

This rewrite implents ES2015 (w/ Babel), Webpack, Sass, and Ava for testing.

Getting Started
---------------

clone and run `npm install` from the root directory.


Structure
---------

#### legacy/createRaster-old.js
The original code base

#### legacy/createRaster-maps.js
This I think is basically the original code base with maps basically dropped in to see if it would work.

#### gegrids/
This is the current rewrite
